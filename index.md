Vote for the server to restart, and the minigame you want (or go out on a limb with a random game).

## &#x1F4C8;
When a majority is reached the server will begin the countdown.

## &#x1F3B2;
The server will then pick the game, if a game has 80% of the vote, there is an 20% chance there will be a random game.

## &#x1F308;
Players are then dropped into the new minigame, don't like it? Just vote again!
